Overview
--------

HL7v2 stands for "Health Level 7: Version 2". This was the first version of a
specification for shuttling clinical data around and between medical
institutions. While working on [Medtasker](http://medtasker.com/) with
[Nimblic](https://github.com/nimblic), I've written this library for reading
the protocol and querying the messages it contains.

I have a [blog post](https://www.fknsrs.biz/blog/golang-hl7-library.html) on
my website if you'd like to hear a bit more of the story.
